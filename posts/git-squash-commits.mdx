A really quick step-by-step guide on how to squash Git commits to make your PRs concise, easy to read, and hence easy to review.

Steps:

- Make sure your branch is up to date with the `main` branch.
- Run `git rebase -i main`.
- You should see a list of commits, each commit starting with the word "pick".
- Make sure the first commit says "pick" and change the rest from "pick" to "squash". -- This will squash each commit into the previous commit, which will continue until every commit is squashed into the first commit.
- Save and close the editor (press `Esc` key, type `:w` and hit `Enter` key) -- save a file and quit vim / Vi by pressing `Esc` key, type `:x` and hit `Enter` key.
- It will give you the opportunity to change the commit message.
- Save and close the editor again.
- Force push the squashed commit: `git push --force-with-lease origin`.
